# SOC-Automation-Lab

Acknowledgement: This project benefitted greatly from the tutorial provided by the Youtube Channel [MYDFIR](https://www.youtube.com/@mydfir). MYDFIR's video series on the project were extremly helpful in understanding and implementing the various elements of the SOC Automation Lab project

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
This project aims to develop an automated SOC homelab, highly inspired by MyDFIR’s youtube series on the same topic. The full playlist can be found at [SOC Automation Project[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR3eamn8ydQ). In today’s rapidly changing cybersecurity environment, the importance of having a strong Security Operation Center (SOCs) has never been greater. As cyber threats grow more advanced, organizations must constantly evolve and improve their detection and response capabilities to protect their assets and data. For aspiring SOC analysts, one method is to build a fully automated SOC homelab to hone their skills in a controlled environment. 

### 1.2 Objectives
- **Hands-on Experience- The primary objective of this project is to provide oneself with hands-on experience in setting up, configuring, and operating a Security Operations Center in a simulated environment.
- **Experience with Tools- By using a range of open-source tools commonly used in real-world SOCs, including Wazuh for alert generation, Shuffle for SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) and TheHive for case management.
- **Incident Response Training- We can simulate various cybersecurity incidents, allowing aspiring analysts to practice incident detection, analysis, and response procedures in a controlled setting.
- **Integration Testing- The project can also teach how to integrate different security tools seamlessly to streamline the incident response process.
- **Threat Intelligence Enrichment- This project incorporates threat intelligence enrichment capabilities, enabling analysts to enrich the Indicator of Compromise (IOCs) through services like VirusTotal.
